MapReduce IO

Seialisation:
RPC

hashcode, equals, compareTO are methods of WritableComparable interface?

Writable methods:
-readFields()
-write..()

Sequence files contain binary-encoded key-value pairs and metadata about them
It can be uncompressed, record compressed or block compressed (when data reaches the block size it is compresses and written to the file)

Map File:
A sorted SequenceFIle with an index of key and values implemented as a Hashmap

p24/92: Avro files:

compatible with Hadoop via AvroMapper ancd Avro Reducer:
Alternative to Sequence files
Avro is a data serialisation and RPC(Remote Procedure Call) library
The schema is included in the file
They use synchronisation Mappers
